# Offroad Pickup SUVs

## Ford F-150 Raptor

Optimized for off-road use, the Raptor is fitted with four-wheel drive as standard equipment, a mid-travel suspension system, and all-terrain tires. The model is also equipped with the most powerful engines available in the F-150/Ranger lines. Along with wider fenders, the Raptor is fitted with its own grille, replacing the Ford Blue Oval emblem with large "FORD" lettering in the grille.

## GMC Sierra

Astoundingly advanced and exceedingly premium, the 2023 GMC Sierra 1500 is designed for pickup excellence. A tall, confident stance with a 2" factory-installed lift, mud-terrain tires, Red Recovery Hooks and dark, distinguished details create a look that’s as bold as Sierra 1500 AT4’s road capability. Paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and delivering 420 horsepower and 460 lb.-ft. of torque, this engine has the serious power you need for big jobs or big fun.

## Chevrolet Silverado

The Chevrolet Silverado is a range of trucks manufactured by General Motors under the Chevrolet brand. Taking its name from the top trim level from the Chevrolet C/K series, the Silverado is offered as a series of full-size pickup trucks, chassis cab trucks, and medium-duty trucks. The Chevrolet Silverado shares mechanical commonality with the GMC Sierra.

## Toyota Tundra

The Toyota Tundra is a pickup truck manufactured in the United States by the Japanese manufacturer Toyota. The third-generation Tundra is offered with a 3.4-liter V35A-FTS twin-turbocharged V6 engine.
